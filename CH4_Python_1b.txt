Python "An <i>excellent</i> choice, Player! Let's get started!"

"To begin, I'll start with a bit of background info.{c} I am an <i><b>open-source, high-level, general-purpose programming language</b></i> that incorporates the features of object-oriented, structural, and functional programming."
"I offer numerous options for web development.{c} My web frameworks are known for their security, scalability, and flexibility."
"I come loaded with many useful extensions that come in handy for the development of interactive games.{c} Game designers also use me for developing tools to simplify specific actions such as level design or dialog tree creation."
"They even use those tools to export those tasks in formats that can be used by the primary game engine.{c}I am also used a scripting language by many game engines."
"Thanks to my massive library base, I have become a crucial tool in scientific and numeric computing.{c}In fact, I provide the skeleton for applications that deal with computation and scientific data processing."
"I am the <b><i>most favored language of Data Science professionals</i></b>.{c} My simplicity, consistency, platform independence, great collection of resourceful libraries, and active community make me the perfect tool for developing AI and Machine Learning applications."
"I offer many GUI toolkits and frameworks that make desktop application development a breeze."
"Software developers use me as a support language for build control, testing, and management.{c} I also support data analyzation and visualization, thereby further simplifying the process of creating custom solutions minus the extra effort and time investment."
"I am a beginner-friendly programming language, and have an extremely <i><b>straightforward syntax that's similar to the English language.</b></i>"
"My easy learning curve and simplicity are the two main reasons why I am one of the most used programming languages in the educational programs, both at beginner and advanced levels."
"Usually I am combined with the C programming language to design and develop operating systems."
"I also find a unique use case in image processing and graphic design applications.{c} I am used globally to design and build 2D imaging software like <i><b>Inkscape, GIMP, Paint, Shop Pro, and Scribus.</b></i>"
"I am also used in several 3D animation packages such as <i><b>Blender, Houdini, 3ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D, and Lightwave.</b></i>"

narrator "Wow <color=blue>Python</color> sure has an extensive and inclusive list of uses! {c} You feel a lot more inspired after your conversation."

[playername] "Thanks for sharing all of this with me <color=blue>Python</color>, you've really given me something to think about!"

Python "Thanks for listening! {c}That was a lot of my uses thrown at you at once!{c} I hope I laid things out in a way that allowed me to keep your attention!
