CSharp "Okay! Here we go."

"During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC)."
"In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for 'C-like Object Oriented Language'."
"They considered keeping Cool as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons..."
"When the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conferences, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to me!"
"James Gosling, who created the <color=orange>Java</color> programming language in 1994, called me an imitation of <color=orange>Java</color>.{c}Gosling further said that I am sort of <color=orange>Java</color> with reliability and productivity and security deleted..."
"In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that I am not a <color=orange>Java</color> clone, and am much close to C++ in my design."
"I make use of reification to provide first-class generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time."
"I have added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the LINQ extensions released with my 3.0 version and my supporting framework of lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous types."
"The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of boilerplate code that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability."
"My name, pronounced C Sharp, was inspired by the musical notation whereby a sharp symbol indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch."
"The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four + symbols (in a two-by-two grid) further implying that the language is an increment of C++."

narrator "C# seems to have a very short and rough history, but he's persevering despite these facts.{c}You feel a lot more inspired after your conversation."

[playername] "Thanks for sharing all of this with me <color=purple>C#</color>, you've really given me something to think about!"

CSharp "I appreciate your listening, hopefully I made my history interesting for you!"
