narrator "<color=yellow>JavaScript</color> smiles at you."

JavaScript "Alright let's get started then!"

"In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named <b><i>Brandan Eich</i></b> developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. {c} I was originally named Mocha, but became known as LiveScript and, later, <color=yellow>JavaScript</color>!"
"I look pretty good for 25, right? {c} I'm primarily a <b><i>client-side language</i></b>, meaning I run on computers within the browser. {c} However, with the introduction of Node.js I can execute code onto servers!"
"Since my release, I've surpassed <color=orange>Java</color>, Flash, and other languages because I am relatively easy to learn, have a free and open community, and most importantly, I'm incredibly useful!"
"For the seventh year in a row (as of 2019) I'm ranked the <b><i>most commonly used programming language</i></b>! With 67.8% of developers employing me in 2019."
"I was created out of necessity, and used to build <i><b>95.2% (1.52 billion)</b></i> of websites today! {c} Including some of the largest, like Facebook, YouTube, eBay, and Google Maps!"
"According to GitHub's 2018 Octoverse report, there are more repositories all about me than any other language!"
"My name came from Netscape's support of <color=orange>Java</color> applets within its browser.{c} Though many say it was also a marketing tactic to divert some attention from <color=orange>Java</color>...{a}serves him right!"
"Though I didn't exactly have the best start, I didn't perform as well and those developing with <color=orange>Java</color> considered me to be more of a UI Glue to be used by designers and non-engineers.{c} How rude!"
"It's thanks to this glue language that allowed the internet to really flourish, {a} you're welcome!"
"2005 was a really big year for me, when a paper released by <b><i>Jesse James Garrett</i></b> introduced <b><i>Ajax</i></b>. {c} Ajax being a revolutionary suite of technologies that included me, Ajax vastly improved user experience by allowing web pages to feel more like native desktop apps."
"Thanks to Ajax, I was really pushed into the spotlight as a professional programming language! Thanks Ajax!"

narrator "<color=yellow>JavaScript</color> is really an underdog of the programming world, but she seems to be doing well for herself. {c} You feel a lot more inspired after your conversation."

[playername] "Thanks for sharing all of this with me <color=yellow>JavaScript</color>, you've really given me something to think about!"

JavaScript "No problem kid! It's what I'm here for, glad I could help."
