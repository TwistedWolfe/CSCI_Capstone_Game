Java "Alright, well let's get started."

"Let's begin with a little background.{c} I am a programming language, designed to be <i><b>concurrent, class-based and object orientated, as well as a computing platform</i></b>."
"I can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network.{c} I can also be used to build a small application module or <i><b>applet, a simply designed, small application for use as a part of a Web page</b></i>."
"I have become invaluable to developers by enabling them to: write software on one platform and run it on virtually any other platform.{c}Create programs that can run within a web browser and access available web services."
"I can be used to develop server-side application for online forums, stores polls, HTML forms processing, and more.{c} I allow users to <i><b>combine applications or services</b></i> using my language to create highly customized applications or services."
"Using me, users can write powerful and efficient applications for <i><b>mobile phones, remote processors, microcontrollers, wireless modules, sensors, gateways, consumer products, and practically any other electric device.</b></i>"
"<i><b>89%</b></i> of desktops (or computers) in the US run me. {c} I have <b><i>9 million developers worldwide</i></b>, and I am the number one choice for developers."
"I can be used for the development of scientific application, desktop GUI application, development of web applications, mobile applications, enterprise applications development, application servers and web servers."
"I am not too complicated to understand. {c} I represent an instance of a class like <i><b>encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism</b></i>. {c} I have no complication in my features like an <i><b>inheritance, pointer, operator overloading, etc.</b></i>"
