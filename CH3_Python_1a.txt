Python "An <i>excellent</i> choice, Player! Let's get started!"

"I was initially designed by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> in 1991 and developed by <b>Python Software Foundation</b>.{c}The programming language which I'm said to have succeeded is <i>ABC Programming Language</i>, which had the interfacing with the <b>Amoeba Operating System</b> and had the feature of exception handling."
"Rossum had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career...and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features.{c} After that what he did as really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too...so he fixed those issues!"
"I was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and my syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.{c} When I was released I had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions."
"I am dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.{c} I support multiple programming paradigms, <i><b>including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming</b></i>.{c} I am often described as a "batteries included" language due to my comprehensive standard library."
"I am an <i><b>interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language</b></i>.{c} My design philosophy emphasizes code readability with my notable use of significant indentation."
"My core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python,{a} which includes aphorisms such as:{c}"
"Beautiful is better than ugly.{c} Explicit is better than implicit.{c} Simple is better than complex.{c} Complex is better than complicated.{c} Readability counts."
"I embrace a there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it design philosophy."

narrator "Wow...{a}Python certainly is complex...{a}and seemingly well loved as a language!{c} You feel a lot more inspired after your conversation."

[playername] "Thanks for sharing all of this with me <color=blue>Python</color>, you've really given me something to think about!"

Python "Thanks for listening! {c}That was a lot of my history thrown at you at once!{c} I hope I laid things out in a way that allowed me to keep your attention!
