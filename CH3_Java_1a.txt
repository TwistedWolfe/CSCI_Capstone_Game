Java "Alright, well let's get started."

"I am an <b><i>Object-Oriented programming language</i></b> developed by <i><b>James Gosling</b></i> in the early 1990s.{c} The team initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, television."
"Originally C++ was considered to be used in the project but the idea was rejected for several reasons, for instance <i>C++ required more memory</i>."
"Gosling endeavored to alter and expand C++ however before long surrendered that for making another stage called Green.{c} James Gosling and his team called their project <i><b>Greentalk</b></i> and its file extension was .gt and later became to known as <i><b>OAK</b></i>"
"The name Oak was used by Gosling after an oak tree that remained outside his office. {c} Also Oak is an image of solidarity and picked as a national tree of numerous nations like the USA, France, Germany, and Romania {c} But they had to later rename it as <i><b>JAVA</b></i> as it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies"
"Gosling and his team did a brainstorm session and after the session, they came up with several names such as JAVA, DNA, SILK, RUBY, etc."
"My name was decided after much discussion since it was so unique.{c} My name originates from a sort of espresso bean, Java. {c}Gosling came up with my name while having coffee near his office.{c} You see why I chose this location for our talk?"
"I was created on the principles like <i><b>Robust, Portable, Platform Independent, High Performance, Multithread, etc</b></i>. I was called one of the Ten Best Products of 1995 by TIME MAGAZINE."

narrator "<color=orange>Java</color> is a really sophisticated programming language. {c} You feel a lot more inspired after your conversation."

[playername] "Thanks for sharing all of this with me <color=orange>Java</color>, you've really given me something to think about!"

Java "It's my pleasure [playername], I'm glad you enjoyed."
